## My process

### Built with

-   HTML5
-   CSS
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was one of the most enjoyable challenges for me. I learned how to make an adaptive navbar, tabs and accordion without framework by myself. My layout skills also improved, because there was some tricky parts in this challenge. I first tried mobile-first workflow and I enjoyed it! It made adaptive designing easier.

### Continued development

I think I'll use more JavaScript in my next project, because I want to get a hand with it.
